<div class="markdown prose max-w-none" id="description"><p>An ordered sequence of numbers from 1 to N is given. One number might have deleted from it, then the remaining numbers were mixed. Find the number that was deleted.</p>
<p>Example: </p>
<ul>
<li>The starting array sequence is <code>[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]</code></li>
<li>The mixed array with one deleted number is <code>[3,2,4,6,7,8,1,9]</code></li>
<li>Your function should return the int <code>5</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>If no number was deleted from the array and no difference with it, your function should return the int <code>0</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: N may be 1 or less (in the latter case, the first array will be <code>[]</code>).</p>
